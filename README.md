This repo consists of my projects for COS350 Computer Graphics. 

The language being used for this project is a very new language called V.

You can install V from the Vlang documentation [https://vlang.io].

Once V is downloaded, run the executable. It will compile and get everything setup.

A shortcut for running your V files is to use the keywords v{filepathToV} run [filename.v] 
So for example to run all v files in the current project you could do: **v run .**

V is a language with the goal to be as fast as C++, but as readable and user friendly as Python.
