The P02_Raytrace.v file contains the main code in this project, with helper functions and structs defined in the gfx directory. 

There are reference images in the 'reference' folder and once you compile the .v file there will be an executable created that generated output in the 'output' folder.

If using the 'run' keyword, then it will automatically compile, run the executable, and then delete it. Very convenient.
